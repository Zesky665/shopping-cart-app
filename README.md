# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is a react application for e-commerce -->e-shoping cart

In order to run the frontned app you need to:
Install the npm dependencies like this.
```
npm-install
```
Navigate to the correct directory:
```
cd eshopfrontend
```
And then run the app:
```
npm run dev 
```

Once this is done you can see the running app on this [address](http://localhost:5173/).


In order to run the backend you need to:

in appsettings.json to change the name of your local server for the database.

Then open the package manager console and type:
```
